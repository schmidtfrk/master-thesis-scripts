# master-thesis-scripts
This repository contains a library for calculating liner-optical logical Bell measurement efficiencies of quantum codes and shall simplify generalizations of the work of my thesis.
Additionally there are some python scripts which calculate the efficiencies for some examples or they are used within a proof in the thesis. The Mathematica scripts show calculations of the chapter 'State discrimination with linear optics'.
